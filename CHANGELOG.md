# Changelog

+ **1.5.0** - _05/23/2018_
  - Add the capability to validate params based on documented parameters on endpoints. Invoking
    `brainstem_validate_params!` raises an error if unknown parameters are encountered.

+ **1.4.1** - _05/09/2018_
  - Add the capability to specify an alternate base application / engine the routes are derived from.
    This capability is specific to documemtation generation.

+ **1.3.0** - _04/12/2018_
  - Add the capability to nest fields under evaluable parent blocks where the nested fields are evaluated
    with the resulting value of the parent field.
    ```ruby
        fields :tags, :array,
               info: "The tags for the given category",
               dynamic: -> (widget) { widget.tags } do |tag|

          tag.field :name, :string,
                    info: "Name of the assigned tag"
        end
    ```
  - Add support for nested parameters on an endpoint.
    ```ruby
        model_params :post do |param|
          ...

          param.valid :message, :string, ...

          param.model_params :rating do |rating_param|
            ...

            rating_param.valid :stars, :integer, ...
          end

          params.valid :replies, :array,
                       item_type: :hash, ... do |reply_params|

            reply_params.valid :message, :string,
                               info: "the message of the post"

            ...
          end
        end
    ```
  - Fix issue with nested fields being unable to have the same name as top level fields. 
  - Support generation of markdown documentation for the nested block fields and nested parameters.

+ **1.2.0** - _03/29/2018_
  - Add the capability to indicate an endpoint param is required with the `required` key in the options hash.
  ```ruby
        params.valid :message, :text,
                     required: true,
                     info: "the message of the post"
  ```
  - Add support for specifying the type of an endpoint param. For an endpoint param that has type `Array`,
    type of list items can be specified using `item_type` key in the options hash.
  ```ruby
        params.valid :viewable_by, :array,
                     item_type: :integer,
                     info: "an array of user ids that can access the post"
  ```
  - Add support for specifying the data type of an item for a presenter field using `item_type` key in the
    options hash when the field is of type `Array`.
  ```ruby
        field :aliases, :array,
              item_type: :string,
              info: "an array of user ids that can access the post"
  ```
  - Include the type and item type when generating markdown documentation for endpoint params.
  - Specify the data type of a filter and available values with `items` key in the options hash. If filter is an array,
    data type of items can be specified with the `item_type` property in options.
  ```ruby
        filter :status, :string,
               items: ['Started', 'Completed'],
               info: "only returns elements with the given status"

        filter :sprocket_ids, :array,
               item_type: :integer,
               info: "returns objects associated with given sprocket Ids"
  ```
  - Add support for generating markdown documentation for the following:
    - when the `required` option is specified on an endpoint param
    - when the `type` and `item_type` params are specified on the endpoint param
    - when the `type` and `item_type` params are specified on a presenter field
    - when the `type` and `items` params are specified on a presenter filter

+ **1.1.1** - _01/15/2017_
  - Add `Brainstem.mysql_use_calc_found_rows` boolean config option to utilize MySQL's [FOUND_ROWS()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-functions.html#function_found-rows) functionality to avoid issuing a new query to calculate the record count, which has the potential to up to double the response time of the endpoint.

+ **1.1.0** - _12/18/2017_
  - Add `meta` key to API responses which includes `page_number`, `page_count`, and `page_size` keys.

+ **1.0.0** - _07/20/2017_
  - Add the capability to generate the documentation extracted from your properly annotated
    presenters and controllers using `bundle exec brainstem generate [ARGS]`.
  - Update Brainstem to use Ruby version 2.3.3.
  - Add support for Ruby versions 2.2.7, 2.3.4 & 2.4.1 and drop support for Ruby version 2.1.10.
  - Drop support for specifying description param as a string and not with the `info` key in the options hash.

+ **1.0.0.pre.2** - _04/12/2017_
  - Added support for specifying the description for conditionals, fields and associations with the `info` key in the options hash.
  - Added a deprecation warning when description param is specified as a string and not with the `info` key in the options hash.
  - Fixed: support for conditional, field and association options to be a hash with indifferent access.

+ **1.0.0.pre.1** - _03/07/2017_
  - Implemented new presenter DSL.
  - Added controller helpers for presenting errors.
  - Added support for optional fields.
  - Added support for filtering in conjunction with your search implementation.
  - Added support for defining lookup caches for dynamic fields.
  - Fixed: documentation for default filters.
  - Fixed: ambiguity of `brainstem_key` for presenters that present multiple classes.
  - Fixed: non-deterministic order when sorting records with identical sortable fields (`updated_at`, for instance).

+ **1.0.0.pre** - _10/5/2015_

  + Complete rewrite of the Presenter DSL allowing for introspection and (soon) automatic API documentation.

+ **0.2.5** - _07/22/2014_

  + `Brainstem::Presenter#load_associations!` now:
    + polymorphic 'belongs_to' association is represented as a hash which includes:
      + id: The id of the polymorphic object
      + key: The table name for the class of the polymorphic object

+ **0.2.4** - _01/9/2014_

  + `Brainstem::ControllerMethods#present_object` now simulates an only request (by providing the `only` parameter to Brainstem) when attempting to present a single model.

+ **0.2.3** - _11/21/2013_

  + `Brainstem::ControllerMethods#present_object` now runs the default filters that are defined in the presenter.

  + `Brainstem.presenter_collection` now takes two optional options:
    + `raise_on_empty` - Boolean that defaults to false and when set to true will raise an exception (default: `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`) when the result set is empty.
    + `empty_error_class` - Exception class to raise when `raise_on_empty` is true.
