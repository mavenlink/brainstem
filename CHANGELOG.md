+ **0.2.5** - _07/22/2014_

  + `Brainstem::Presenter#load_associations!` now:

      + id: The id of the polymorphic object
      + key: The table name for the class of the polymorphic object

+ **0.2.4** - _01/9/2014_

  + `Brainstem::ControllerMethods#present_object` now simulates an only request (by providing the `only` parameter to Brainstem) when attempting to present a single model.

  + `Brainstem::ControllerMethods#present_object` now runs the default filters that are defined in the presenter.

  + `Brainstem.presenter_collection` now takes two optional options:
    + `raise_on_empty` - Boolean that defaults to false and when set to true will raise an exception (default: `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`) when the result set is empty.
    + `empty_error_class` - Exception class to raise when `raise_on_empty` is true.
