# Changelog

+ **2.3.4** - _08/03/2018_
  ### New Features
  - Add the ability to delegate count evaluation to presenter which can be useful for caching counts across requests. The block evaluates within the context of any helpers defined for the presenter.
    ```ruby
    class LineItemPresenter < Brainstem::Presenter
      # presenter...
      count_evaluator do |count_scope|
        cached_count? ? cached_count : count_scope.count
      end
    end
    ```
+ **2.3.0** - _10/09/2019_
  ### Version Support
    - Add official Rails 6.0 compatibility
    - Drop support for Rails 4.1 and below

  ### Bugfixes
    - Address deprecation warnings for Rails 6 by wrapping raw sql in `Arel.sql`

+ **2.2.0** - _08/15/2019_
  ### Bugfixes
    - Add support for API documentation generation in Rails 5.x
    - Address deprecation warnings for Rails 6 by wrapping raw sql in `Arel.sql`

+ **2.1.0** - _05/10/2019_
  ### New Features
    - Add the ability to mark properties as internal for Open API.
    ```ruby
    class ContactsController < ApiController
      internal! "Only used internally"

      brainstem_params do
        actions :index do
          response :hash do
            field :count, :integer,
                  info: "Total count of contacts",
                  internal: "Internal eyes only"
            fields :contacts, :array,
                   item_type: :hash,
                   nodoc: true,
                   info: "Array of contact details" do
              field :full_name, :string,
                    info: "Full name of the contact",
                    internal: true
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```
    
    - Add `--include-internal` option to CLI:
      `brainstem generate --include-internal --open-api-specification=2` will generate documentation for
      everything that is not marked as `nodoc`.
    
    - Automatically generate documentation for associations
      - `response_key` will be used if given, otherwise, it will use the name of the association appended
        with `_id` or `_ids` for `has_many`.

        Using the example below, the association for `PetCategory` will generate documentation for `shooby_id`,
        while the `Owner` association will generate documentation for `owner_id`.
      - The response will include references to all of the associations, including any `polymorphic_classes` added to
        polymorphic associations.

        In the example below, the documentation for the response will contain references to `PetCategory`, `Vaccine`,
        `Owner`, `Dog`, and `Cat`.

    ```ruby
    class PetsPresenter < Brainstem::Presenter
      presents Pet

      associations do
        association :pet_category, PetCategory,
                    response_key: :shooby_id,
                    type: :belongs_to
        association :vaccines, Vaccine,
                    response_key: :vaccine_ids,
                    type: :has_many
        association :owner, Owner,
                    response_key: :owner_id,
                    type: :has_one
        association :pettable, :polymorphic,
                    response_key: :pettable_ref,
                    polymorphic_classes: [Dog, Cat]
      end
    end
    ```

    - Add support for non-static key fields in responses. When key is non-static, use the new DSL for response params.
      See example below for usage.

       ```ruby
        {
            :attributes => {
                :"#{name}_field" => 'world',
                :"#{name}_ids" => [1, 2, 3],
                :name => name
            },
            :"#{model.class_name}_klass" => {
                :"#{model.class_name}_identifier" => model.identifier,
                :"#{model.association_name}_ids" => [1, 2, 3]
            }
        }
       ```

       A response with non-static key fields written above can be described as follows:

       ```ruby
       class ContactsController < ApiController
         brainstem_params do
           actions :show do
             response :hash do |response_param|
               response_param.fields :attributes, :hash do |attributes|
                 attributes.dynamic_key_field :string
                 attributes.field :some_ids, :array, dynamic: true
                  attributes.field :name, :string, required: true
               end

               response_param.dynamic_key_field :hash do |dk|
                 dk.dynamic_key_field :string
                 dk.field :other_ids, :array, dynamic: true
               end
             end
           end
         end
       end
       ```

    - Add support for non-static key params. When key is non-static, use the new DSL for request params.
      See example below for usage.

      A param with non-static keys like `{ contact.id => 10, :"#{contact.friends_association_name}_ids" => [1, 2, 3] }`
      can be described as follows:

      ```ruby
      class ContactsController < ApiController
        brainstem_params do
          actions :create do
            valid :info, :hash, required: true do |param|
              param.valid_dynamic_param :integer, required: true
              param.valid :some_ids, :array, dynamic: true
            end
          end
        end
      end
      ```

    - Sort orders now default to directions `asc` and `desc`.
      When direction is passed as false, no sort order is generated for the docs.
      - ex.
        ```ruby
          presenter_class.sort_order :created_at, value, info: "sorts by creation time", direction: false
        ```

    - Add new DSL for nested arrays
      ```ruby
        response :array, nested_level: 2, item_type: :hash do
          nested.field :a, :string
          nested.field :b, :integer
        end
      ```
      - An example of the response above: `[[{a: "string", b: 1}, "another string", 4]]`

  ### Bugfixes
    - Nested required fields will now no longer bubble up the required to its parent. A deeply nested field that is 
    required will now only be required on its direct parent.
    - Required fields for a create / update (POST / PUT) request are explicitly called out in the OAS specification
    - Default top-level query params like `only `, `order `, `page`, `per_page`, `include` & `optional` are not
    displayed when the endpoint is not returning brainstem models.

+ **2.0.0** - _05/17/2018_
  - Introduce the capability to document custom response on endpoints
  ```ruby
  class ContactsController < ApiController
    brainstem_params do
      actions :index do
        response :hash do
          field :count, :integer,
                info: "Total count of contacts"

          fields :contacts, :array,
                 item_type: :hash,
                 info: "Array of contact details" do

            field :full_name, :string,
                  info: "Full name of the contact"
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
  ```
  - Add DSL on controllers to set Open API Specification 2.0 configurations
  ```ruby
  class PetsController < ApiController
    brainstem_params do
      # The `tag` configuration allows grouping of all endpoints
      # in a controller under the same group.
      tag "Adopt a Pet"

      # The `tag_group` configuration introduces another level of nesting
      # and allows grouping multiple controllers under a specific group
      tag_groups "Dogs", "Cats"

      # A list of default MIME types, endpoints on this controller can consume.
      consumes "application/xml", "application/json"

      # A list of default MIME types, endpoints on this controller can produce.
      produces "application/xml"

      # A declaration of which security schemes are applied to endpoints on this controller.
      security []

      # The default transfer protocols for endpoints on this controller.
      schemes "https", "http"

      # Additional external documentation
      external_doc description: 'External Doc',
                   url: 'www.google.com'

      # Declares endpoints on this controller to be deprecated.
      deprecated true

      actions :update do
        # Overriden MIME types the endpoints can consume.
        consumes "application/json"

        # A list of default MIME types the endpoints can produce.
        produces "application/json"

        # Security schemes for this endpoint.
        security { "petstore_auth" => [ "write:pets" ] }

        # Transfer protocols applicable to this endpoint.
        schemes "https"

        # External documentation for the endpoint.
        external_doc description: 'Stock Market News',
                     url: 'www.google.com/finance'

        # Overrides the deprecated value set on the root context.
        deprecated false
      end
    end
  end
  ```
  - Add the capability to generate Open API Specification 2.0

+ **1.4.1** - _05/09/2018_
  - Add the capability to specify an alternate base application / engine the routes are derived from.
    This capability is specific to documemtation generation.

+ **1.3.0** - _04/12/2018_
  - Add the capability to nest fields under evaluable parent blocks where the nested fields are evaluated
    with the resulting value of the parent field.
    ```ruby
        fields :tags, :array,
               info: "The tags for the given category",
               dynamic: -> (widget) { widget.tags } do |tag|

          tag.field :name, :string,
                    info: "Name of the assigned tag"
        end
    ```
  - Add support for nested parameters on an endpoint.
    ```ruby
        model_params :post do |param|
          ...

          param.valid :message, :string, ...

          param.model_params :rating do |rating_param|
            ...

            rating_param.valid :stars, :integer, ...
          end

          params.valid :replies, :array,
                       item_type: :hash, ... do |reply_params|

            reply_params.valid :message, :string,
                               info: "the message of the post"

            ...
          end
        end
    ```
  - Fix issue with nested fields being unable to have the same name as top level fields. 
  - Support generation of markdown documentation for the nested block fields and nested parameters.

+ **1.2.0** - _03/29/2018_
  - Add the capability to indicate an endpoint param is required with the `required` key in the options hash.
  ```ruby
        params.valid :message, :text,
                     required: true,
                     info: "the message of the post"
  ```
  - Add support for specifying the type of an endpoint param. For an endpoint param that has type `Array`,
    type of list items can be specified using `item_type` key in the options hash.
  ```ruby
        params.valid :viewable_by, :array,
                     item_type: :integer,
                     info: "an array of user ids that can access the post"
  ```
  - Add support for specifying the data type of an item for a presenter field using `item_type` key in the
    options hash when the field is of type `Array`.
  ```ruby
        field :aliases, :array,
              item_type: :string,
              info: "an array of user ids that can access the post"
  ```
  - Include the type and item type when generating markdown documentation for endpoint params.
  - Specify the data type of a filter and available values with `items` key in the options hash. If filter is an array,
    data type of items can be specified with the `item_type` property in options.
  ```ruby
        filter :status, :string,
               items: ['Started', 'Completed'],
               info: "only returns elements with the given status"

        filter :sprocket_ids, :array,
               item_type: :integer,
               info: "returns objects associated with given sprocket Ids"
  ```
  - Add support for generating markdown documentation for the following:
    - when the `required` option is specified on an endpoint param
    - when the `type` and `item_type` params are specified on the endpoint param
    - when the `type` and `item_type` params are specified on a presenter field
    - when the `type` and `items` params are specified on a presenter filter

+ **1.1.1** - _01/15/2017_
  - Add `Brainstem.mysql_use_calc_found_rows` boolean config option to utilize MySQL's [FOUND_ROWS()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-functions.html#function_found-rows) functionality to avoid issuing a new query to calculate the record count, which has the potential to up to double the response time of the endpoint.

+ **1.1.0** - _12/18/2017_
  - Add `meta` key to API responses which includes `page_number`, `page_count`, and `page_size` keys.

+ **1.0.0** - _07/20/2017_
  - Add the capability to generate the documentation extracted from your properly annotated
    presenters and controllers using `bundle exec brainstem generate [ARGS]`.
  - Update Brainstem to use Ruby version 2.3.3.
  - Add support for Ruby versions 2.2.7, 2.3.4 & 2.4.1 and drop support for Ruby version 2.1.10.
  - Drop support for specifying description param as a string and not with the `info` key in the options hash.

+ **1.0.0.pre.2** - _04/12/2017_
  - Added support for specifying the description for conditionals, fields and associations with the `info` key in the options hash.
  - Added a deprecation warning when description param is specified as a string and not with the `info` key in the options hash.
  - Fixed: support for conditional, field and association options to be a hash with indifferent access.

+ **1.0.0.pre.1** - _03/07/2017_
  - Implemented new presenter DSL.
  - Added controller helpers for presenting errors.
  - Added support for optional fields.
  - Added support for filtering in conjunction with your search implementation.
  - Added support for defining lookup caches for dynamic fields.
  - Fixed: documentation for default filters.
  - Fixed: ambiguity of `brainstem_key` for presenters that present multiple classes.
  - Fixed: non-deterministic order when sorting records with identical sortable fields (`updated_at`, for instance).

+ **1.0.0.pre** - _10/5/2015_

  + Complete rewrite of the Presenter DSL allowing for introspection and (soon) automatic API documentation.

+ **0.2.5** - _07/22/2014_

  + `Brainstem::Presenter#load_associations!` now:
    + polymorphic 'belongs_to' association is represented as a hash which includes:
      + id: The id of the polymorphic object
      + key: The table name for the class of the polymorphic object

+ **0.2.4** - _01/9/2014_

  + `Brainstem::ControllerMethods#present_object` now simulates an only request (by providing the `only` parameter to Brainstem) when attempting to present a single model.

+ **0.2.3** - _11/21/2013_

  + `Brainstem::ControllerMethods#present_object` now runs the default filters that are defined in the presenter.

  + `Brainstem.presenter_collection` now takes two optional options:
    + `raise_on_empty` - Boolean that defaults to false and when set to true will raise an exception (default: `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`) when the result set is empty.
    + `empty_error_class` - Exception class to raise when `raise_on_empty` is true.
